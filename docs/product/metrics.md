## North-star
| Metric | Target (falsifiable) | Current | Read on | Trend |
|--------|----------------------|---------|---------|-------|
| Generation beats controls: rate at which Momir pools contain admission-worthy canonical growth vs the random-search control on the MVP fixture (HLD §28.2) | ≥ K× the random-search rate over the first N adjudicated pools after Phase G; K and N fixed by the §22.11 cost model (simic-642c2c1823) before Phase A | N/A — pre-code | 2026-08-08 | — |

## Input metrics (the levers that move the north-star)
| Metric | Target | Current | Read on |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| Design-debt burn-down: open `hld-review` tracker items | 0 by 2026-08-31 | 38 open / 12 closed — flat across session 9 (2026-08-09), an owner-directed static-content quality session (PDR-0018, outside the burn-down). **Second consecutive flat session: the pacing warning session 8 armed now FIRES.** 22 days to the pacing date needs ~1.7 closures per working day; next DECIDE must either resume wave:1 closures or re-plan the date by PDR (PDR-0005: a fired signal must fire, never drift silently) | 2026-08-09 (session 9 checkpoint) |
| Phase progression: HLD §25 phases with acceptance tests (§21) passing | Phase A complete by 2026-09-30 (provisional — revise by PDR if the gate reshapes §9 materially) | 0 of 11 (pre-code) | 2026-08-08 |

## Guardrails (must NOT degrade)
| Metric | Floor / ceiling | Current | Read on |
|--------|-----------------|---------|---------|
| Academy exact-replay gate: identical snapshot + identical future data ⇒ bitwise-identical traces (HLD §18, invariant 5) | Floor: 100% pass, from Phase D onward | N/A — pre-code | 2026-08-08 |
| History completeness: candidate pools, failures, rejections, no-op wins and abstentions retained in Urborg (never winners-only) | Floor: 100% of cases | N/A — pre-code | 2026-08-08 |
| Harmful-intervention rate under admitted growth (HLD §28.6) | Ceiling: the tail-risk veto's declared operating point per assurance class — shape fixed by ADR-0004 (INV-45: veto precedes utility, non-tradeable, priced against snapshot distance); numbers land with the Phase-A adjudication-policy LLD | N/A — pre-code | 2026-08-08 (session 6: shape bound) |
